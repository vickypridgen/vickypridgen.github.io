# The i-team's Mission

<p> In Austin, there are over 2,000 individuals without a safe place to sleep. There are many reasons a person can become homeless, and these reasons range from the lack of affordable housing to the loss of family and community. 

In 2017, the Innovation Office secured a three-year $1.25m grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies to focus on the city's goal of ending homelessness.  The grant funds an i-team to help the city identify the best ways for City Council, departments, and the community to collaborate towards a shared understanding of homelessness in Austin.</p>

## Mayor Adler on the i-team

<p>"This grant will help us tackle problems in new ways that reflect who we are in Austin, and I'm excited to see what can come from this. When we effectively ended veteran homelessness, we learned how effective new partnerships between the business community, philanthropists, and nonprofits could be. Bloomberg's grant will allow our Innovation Office to experiment with new ways to house the homeless."</p>
